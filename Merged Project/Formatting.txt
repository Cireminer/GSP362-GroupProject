abBuf.m_desc = "This is what's seen when the ability is used.";
abBuf.m_unlockLevel = 2; //Player gains this ability at level 2

-New Item-
In Items.cpp, SpawnItems()
Item instanceName;
instanceName.SetWearSlot(HEAD); //This is where the item can be worn (if at all)
instanceName.SetName("testitem"); //this is the name the player will type to target the item for wearing and such (wear testitem)
instanceName.SetDesc("A test item floats before you."); //this is what is seen when the player types look
instanceName.SetShort("a simple test item"); //this is what is seen when the player types inventory or equipment
instanceName.SetStrboost(1); //choose what stats you want changed while wearing this item. in this case, strength by positive 1.
instanceName.SetAsBoost(3); //you can boost multiple stats
instanceName.SetAgiBoost(-2); //you can have negative boosts
instanceName.SetSaveLocation(IN_NPC); //This is the location of the item when first spawned into the world.
instanceName.SetRoomId(1); //**IF** the item spawns IN_NPC or IN_ROOM, you need to give the ID of the room it is in.
instanceName.SetNpcName("soldier"); //**IF** the item spawns IN_NPC, you need to give the name of the NPC it is in.
instanceName.SetUseAffect(HP); //**IF** the item has NONE as the wear slot, it can be a use item. This is what the use will affect.
instanceName.SetUseAffectAmount(5); //**IF** the item is a use item, this is how much it will affect the chosen stat. (in this case, HP by 5)
m_items.push_back(instanceName); //This adds the item to the final list of items
instanceName.SetItemId(itemId); //set the item id
itemId++; //increment the item id
//Certain functions are not necessary for certain items. You don't need to call SetRoomId() if the item is not IN_NPC or IN_ROOM.
//You do not have to call SetNpcName() if the item is not IN_NPC.
//You don't need to call SetUseAffect() or SetUseAFfectAmount() if the item does not have the wear slot of NONE (a use item)
